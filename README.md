# NCBI_BLAST_Project
Mini bioinformatics project comparing two DNA sequences using NCBI BLAST

Steps Performed:
1. Selected two DNA sequences (22 bases each)
2. Used NCBI BLASTN tool to align the sequences
3. Observed 95% identity and E-value = 4e-09

Files Included:
`GRN5B9UA114-Alignment.txt` → Original BLAST output  
`Summary.txt` → Brief project interpretation

Result:
Sequences are nearly identical with one base difference (point mutation).
