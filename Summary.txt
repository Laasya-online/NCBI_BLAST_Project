Title: NCBI BLAST DNA Alignment Mini Project
Tool Used: NCBI BLAST (Web)

Objective:
To compare two short DNA sequences and find their similarity using BLASTN.

Observation:
The BLAST output shows 21 out of 22 bases matched (95% identity).
E-value = 4e-09 indicates a highly significant alignment.
This means the two DNA sequences are almost identical with one base difference.

Conclusion:
The sequences are very similar, suggesting a point mutation or single nucleotide variation.
